# Installing Helm

There is an excellent guide on how to install Helm on your local machine
at [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Please follow the instructions using the `From the Binaries` option. The Helm binaries
can be found on the [official Helm release page in GitHub](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).

!!! danger "Always install Helm v3"
    Please install Helm v3 even if you have Helm v2 installed. All documentation will be based
    on Helm v3 and some examples will not work with Helm v2.
