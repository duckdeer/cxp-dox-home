# Installing Helm

There is an excellent guide on how to install Helm on your local machine
at [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Please follow the instructions using the `From the Binaries` option. The Helm binaries
can be found on the [official Helm release page in GitHub](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases).
