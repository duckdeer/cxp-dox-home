# Introducing Docker

Since 2013, Docker significantly changed the way we create and run software. If you want to learn more about Docker, 
here's the suggested path through the Docker documentation section:

!!! tip "Refer to the official Docker documentation for more information"
    This Docker documentation section can only scratch the surface of all capabilities which Docker has to offer. In you want
    to dig deeper, please refer to the [offical Docker engine documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) which is excellent!

* [Docker vs Virtual Machines](docker_vs_virtual_machines.md) compares Docker technology to "old-school" virtualization with virtual machines.

* How Docker works (assignment)

* [From Dockerfile to a running Docker Container](docker_dockerfile_2_container.md) introduces you to Docker terminology 
in general and to the development process from a Dockerfile to a running Docker container in particular.

* [From Dockerfile to a running Docker Container (Walkthrough)](docker_dockerfile_2_container_by_example.md) 
walks you through the complete development process from a Dockerfile to a running Docker Container by a concrete example.

* [Docker Container Storage](docker_storage.md) tells you how you can add persistent storage to your Docker container.

* [Docker Best Practices](docker_best_practices.md) provides you with important information about DO's and DON'Ts regarding Docker.
