# Introducing Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, 
that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. 
Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

It is and will be the unchallenged leader when it comes to container orchestration on a large scale.

!!! tip "Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for more information"
    Again this documentation section can only scratch the surface of all capabilities which Kubernetes has to offer. In you want
    to dig deeper, please refer to the [offical Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) which is excellent!

* [Getting Started with Kubernetes](k8s_introduction.md) will start with some basics about Kubernetes.
